# Step 4: Build

Step 4 is where the product gets built — incrementally, with review at each step, and always in alignment with the design decisions made in Steps 1–3.

This is not "vibe and ship." Every task is traceable to a design decision. Every change is reviewed before it merges. Every release is versioned and documented.

---

## How This Level Works

### The Task Cycle

1. Pick the next task from `BACKLOG.md`
2. Create a branch named for the task (e.g., `feat/user-signup` or `fix/login-error`)
3. Work with Claude to implement — referencing the relevant design documents throughout
4. Before merging, verify against `02-design/SECURITY_PRIVACY.md`, `02-design/ACCESSIBILITY.md`, and any other relevant constraints
5. Commit with a clear message, push, and open a pull request for human review
6. Merge to main — **remove the item from `BACKLOG.md`** and add it to `CHANGELOG.md`
7. When `BACKLOG.md` is empty, the milestone is done — cut a tagged release 🎉

**`BACKLOG.md` is a queue, not a ledger.** Items are removed when merged. An empty backlog means you shipped something. Completed work goes in `CHANGELOG.md`.

### After a Milestone — Iterate

Shipping isn't the end — it's the start of the feedback loop. After a release, use `/hacky-hours step 5` to capture what you've learned: bugs, user feedback, ideas. The iteration cycle follows the same shape (capture → synthesize → prioritize → build) but amends existing docs rather than creating new ones.

### Semantic Versioning

Releases follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

| Version bump | When to use |
|-------------|------------|
| `PATCH` (0.0.x) | Bug fixes and small corrections |
| `MINOR` (0.x.0) | New features, backwards-compatible |
| `MAJOR` (x.0.0) | Breaking changes or major milestones |

The MVP release is `0.1.0`. V1 is `1.0.0`.

## Before Merging Any Task

Claude should verify these before considering a task complete:

- [ ] The implementation matches the relevant design document(s)
- [ ] No secrets, API keys, or credentials are in the code or commit history
- [ ] All user input that crosses a trust boundary is validated
- [ ] Error messages don't expose internal system state
- [ ] The change has been manually tested against the relevant user journey

---

## Done Enough to Move On?

A milestone is complete when:
- `BACKLOG.md` is empty for that milestone
- The product does what you said it would
- `CHANGELOG.md` is updated and a tagged release has been cut

Then: run the housekeeping checklist (move completed roadmap milestone to `archive/`, trim old CHANGELOG entries, review `.claudeignore`), and start the next iteration with `/hacky-hours step 5`.

## Claude Guidance for This Step

When helping a user at Step 4:
- Before starting any task, re-read the relevant sections of Step 2 design documents. Decisions made there constrain implementation.
- When the design document doesn't address something you need to implement, surface it to the user rather than guessing — it may need to be added to the design doc first
- Remind the user to review each PR before merging, even if they're the only contributor — a moment of human review catches things that code review by Claude misses
- When a task is merged, remove it from `BACKLOG.md` and add it to `CHANGELOG.md` — don't wait for the user to ask
- If a project `CLAUDE.md` exists with state machine instructions, follow them at the start of every session
- Never mark a task complete if the security checklist in `SECURITY_PRIVACY.md` has unresolved items
- After the milestone BACKLOG is empty, prompt the user: "Want to run the release process?" — don't assume they want to continue without direction
