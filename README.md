# hacky-hours-docs

A community framework for building apps with LLMs — the Hacky Hours way — created by [Empathetech](https://www.empathetech.org). 🛠️🤗

**For anyone who has an idea and wants to build it** — whether you've shipped a dozen products or you're writing your first line of code. No prior experience required. Just bring the idea.

This repo is two things at once:

1. **A documentation framework** — explains the Hacky Hours philosophy, four-level system, and best practices for LLM-assisted development
2. **A fork-able project template** — fork it, fill in the templates for your own project, and use the resulting docs as in-session context for Claude Code

## The Core Idea

You drive the product. Claude helps you build it — but it needs your direction, not just your instructions. This framework gives you the artifacts to provide that direction: who you're building for, what you're making, how it should work, and what values it should uphold.

The goal isn't to vibe-code without direction, and it isn't to get paralyzed trying to plan everything perfectly. It's to build with confidence, ownership, and growing expertise — one level at a time.

Imperfect documents are fine. Honest documents are what matter.

**This framework defaults to the safest, simplest path.** When Claude makes recommendations, it leads with free tools, minimal infrastructure, privacy-preserving defaults, and accessible design — and explains the tradeoffs before suggesting anything more complex. You can always choose a more powerful option, but you'll make that choice knowingly.

## How It Works

The diagram below shows the four levels from left to right — you start with an idea, work through each level, and end with a shipped product. Each box is a document you'll fill in along the way.

    A([Your Idea]) --> L1

    subgraph L1 ["01-ideate — Capture & Synthesize"]
        B["IDEATION.md\nStream of consciousness notes"] --> C["PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md\nWho · What · Where · When · Why"]
    end

    L1 --> L2

    subgraph L2 ["02-design — Define the Product"]
        D[Architecture] & E[Data Model] & F[User Journeys] & G[Security & Privacy] & H[Style Guide]
    end

    L2 --> L3

    subgraph L3 ["03-roadmap — Prioritize"]
        I["ROADMAP.md\nMVP → V1 → V2"]
    end

    L3 --> L4

    subgraph L4 ["04-build — Build & Ship"]
        J[BACKLOG.md] --> K[Branches & PRs] --> L[Versioned Releases]
    end

    L4 --> M([Shipped Product])
```

Work through these levels in order. Each level's `README.md` explains what "done enough to move on" looks like.

## Four Levels

| Level | Folder | What happens here |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 — Ideation | [`01-ideate/`](./01-ideate/) | Capture raw ideas → synthesize into a product overview |
| 2 — Design | [`02-design/`](./02-design/) | Define the product in detail: architecture, data, UX, security |
| 3 — Roadmap | [`03-roadmap/`](./03-roadmap/) | Prioritize features into MVP / V1 / V2 milestones |
| 4 — Build | [`04-build/`](./04-build/) | Track tasks, manage releases, maintain a changelog |

## Getting Started

**New to all of this?** Start here:
- [Getting started guide](./runbooks/getting-started/README.md) — choose your setup path (zero-install, local, or full terminal)
- [What is a terminal?](./runbooks/getting-started/00-what-is-a-terminal.md) — if that question even crossed your mind
- [What will this cost?](./runbooks/costs.md) — a plain-language cost breakdown
- [FAQ](./runbooks/FAQ.md) — answers to the most common questions

**Ready to build something?**
1. Fork this repo → clone it → open it in VS Code or Codespaces
2. Open [`01-ideate/IDEATION.md`](./01-ideate/IDEATION.md) and start writing
3. Use the [starter prompts](./runbooks/starter-prompts/) to kick off each Claude session
4. Check the [`example/`](./example/) folder to see what completed documents look like

## Use as a Claude Code Command (if you already have Claude Code set up)

> If you're new to Claude Code, start with the [getting started guide](./runbooks/getting-started/README.md) first — this section is for people who already have it installed and running.

Install `/hacky-hours` as a slash command so it works in **any repo you open** — no cloning required. A slash command is a shortcut you type in a Claude Code session (like `/hacky-hours ideate`) that gives Claude a specific workflow to follow.

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/empathetech/hacky-hours-docs/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/empathetech/hacky-hours-docs/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Then type `/hacky-hours` in any Claude Code session. See [`runbooks/install-as-command.md`](./runbooks/install-as-command.md) for full instructions, including the complete argument list (`iterate`, `sync`, `migrate`, `dry-run`, `--root`, and more).

> **Upgrading from v0.x?** Framework artifacts now default to a `hacky-hours/` subfolder. Run `/hacky-hours migrate` to move existing artifacts there — the command will show you exactly what it plans to do before touching anything.

## Using This Repo as a Resource in Another Project (advanced)

> This is for people who already have an existing codebase and want to add the Hacky Hours framework to it. If you're starting fresh, just fork this repo — see the [getting started guide](./runbooks/getting-started/README.md).

You can import this framework into any project so Claude can reference it as in-session context. See [`runbooks/using-this-repo/import-as-resource.md`](./runbooks/using-this-repo/import-as-resource.md) for three approaches, from most to least recommended.
