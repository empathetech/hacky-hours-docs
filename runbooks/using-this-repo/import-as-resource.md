# Import hacky-hours-docs as a Resource

You can bring the Hacky Hours framework into an existing project so Claude Code can reference it as in-session context. This is useful when you want Claude to follow the four-level system inside a codebase that already has its own structure.

Three approaches are described below, in order of recommendation.

---

## Option 1: Git Submodule (recommended)

A git submodule adds this repo as a versioned dependency inside your project. Claude can read its files, and you control exactly which version of the framework you're using.

### Setup

Inside your project:

```bash
# Add the submodule at docs/hacky-hours/
git submodule add https://github.com/empathetech/hacky-hours-docs.git docs/hacky-hours

# Commit the submodule reference
git add .gitmodules docs/hacky-hours
git commit -m "chore: add hacky-hours-docs as submodule"
```

### Cloning a project that already has the submodule

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
```

Or, if you've already cloned:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Updating to the latest framework version

```bash
cd docs/hacky-hours
git pull origin main
cd ../..
git add docs/hacky-hours
git commit -m "chore: update hacky-hours-docs submodule"
```

### Tell Claude where to look

Add this to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Hacky Hours Framework

This project uses the Hacky Hours documentation framework, located at `docs/hacky-hours/`.

Before starting work:
- For new features: read `docs/hacky-hours/build/README.md` and this project's `build/BACKLOG.md`
- For design decisions: read the relevant doc in `docs/hacky-hours/design/` and this project's corresponding design doc
- For security concerns: read `docs/hacky-hours/design/SECURITY_PRIVACY.md` before any implementation that touches user data
```

## Option 2: CLAUDE.md Reference Snippet (lightweight)

If you don't want to add a submodule, you can tell Claude to reference the framework from wherever it's installed on your system. This works well if multiple projects share the same local copy.

Add to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Hacky Hours Framework

This project follows the Hacky Hours four-level documentation framework.
The framework reference lives at: `/path/to/hacky-hours-docs/` (adjust to your local path)

When helping with design decisions, read the relevant template from the framework before making suggestions.
When helping with implementation, read `design/SECURITY_PRIVACY.md` in both the framework and this project before proceeding.
```

This approach requires the framework to be available at a consistent path on every machine where you work.

---

## Option 3: Manual Copy

For the simplest setup — or if you only need one or two documents — copy the relevant folders into your project:

```bash
cp -r path/to/hacky-hours-docs/design/ my-project/docs/design-framework/
```

**Tradeoff:** Your copy won't receive updates from the original framework. This is fine for a stable reference, but you'll need to manually update if the framework evolves.
